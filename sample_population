To determine the sample size (n) required for your research, you need to consider:

Population size (N) = 800 dialysis facilities
Margin of error (E) = Acceptable level of error (e.g., 5%)
Confidence level (Z-score) = Common values:
90% → Z = 1.645
95% → Z = 1.96
99% → Z = 2.576
Expected proportion (p) = Estimated proportion of the characteristic you are measuring (default is 0.5 when unknown)
Sample Size Formula (Cochran's formula for finite populations)


```{r}
calculate_sample_size <- function(N, p = 0.5, E = 0.05, conf_level = 0.95) {
  # Determine Z-score based on confidence level
  Z <- qnorm(1 - (1 - conf_level) / 2)
  
  # Step 1: Compute initial sample size for infinite population
  n0 <- (Z^2 * p * (1 - p)) / (E^2)
  
  # Step 2: Adjust for finite population
  n <- n0 / (1 + ((n0 - 1) / N))
  
  # Round up to the nearest whole number
  return(ceiling(n))
}

# Example: Calculate sample size for 800 dialysis facilities
calculate_sample_size(N = 800, E = 0.05, conf_level = 0.95)
```

For 95% confidence level & 5% margin of error:

```{r}
calculate_sample_size(N = 800, E = 0.05, conf_level = 0.95)
```
